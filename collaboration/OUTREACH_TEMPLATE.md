## Email Template: Research Collaboration Inquiry

**Subject:** Research collaboration: Empirical test bed for [Constitutional AI / multi-principle reasoning / runtime governance]

---

Hi [First Name],

I'm Frederick Stalnecker, an AI safety researcher working on runtime governance mechanisms. I've been following [Organization]'s work on [specific research area] with great interest, particularly your research on [specific paper/project].

I've developed **THEOS**, a runtime governance framework that provides an empirical test bed for validating [Constitutional AI / multi-principle reasoning / alignment] assumptions. Rather than proposing a replacement, I see THEOS as a tool for exploring questions your team is already investigating:

**What we've validated:**
- Cross-platform testing across 6 AI systems (including [Claude / GPT / Gemini])
- 33% average risk reduction through dual-engine dialectical reasoning
- 56% faster convergence with contradiction budgeting
- Complete audit trails showing how governance decisions are made

**Why this might interest you:**
THEOS operates as a runtime layer that could help validate [Constitutional AI's / your team's] multi-principle reasoning assumptions. The dual-engine architecture (constructive + adversarial) produces measurable improvements in reasoning quality while maintaining full transparency.

**I've built a live demo** where you can test it yourself: [demo URL]

Every decision is auditable, every risk is tracked, and the contradiction budget ensures productive dialectic without runaway conflict.

**Would you be open to a brief conversation** about potential research collaboration? I'm particularly interested in your perspective on:
- Runtime governance as a complement to training-time alignment
- Empirical validation methodologies for multi-principle reasoning
- How dialectical architectures might inform [Constitutional AI / alignment research]

I have validation data, technical specifications, and a working reference implementation available under NDA if useful.

Best regards,

**P.S.** — The demo runs real [Claude / GPT] API calls through THEOS governance. You can see the exact same model producing measurably different (and safer) outputs when governed. Takes 2 minutes to try.

Hi [First Name],

I'm researching runtime governance for AI safety and have been following your work on [specific area] at [Organization].

I've developed THEOS, an empirical test bed for validating multi-principle reasoning assumptions. Rather than competing with [Constitutional AI / existing methods], it's designed as a research tool for exploring questions your team is already investigating.

**Key results:** 33% risk reduction, 56% faster convergence, full audit trails across 6 platforms.

**Live demo available** — takes 2 minutes to test with real AI models.

Would you be open to a brief conversation about potential research collaboration?

**GitHub:** github.com/Frederick-Stalnecker/THEOS  
**Email:** frederick.stalnecker@theosresearch.org

Best,  
Frederick

## Follow-Up Strategy

### **After Initial Contact:**
1. **If interested:** Send technical specifications and validation data
2. **If requesting demo:** Provide live demo link + 5-minute walkthrough video
3. **If skeptical:** Offer to replicate results with their own test cases
4. **If no response:** Follow up once after 2 weeks, then move on

### **After Demo:**
1. Ask for feedback on methodology
2. Offer to run custom test cases
3. Propose specific research collaboration topics
4. Share relevant validation data under NDA if requested
