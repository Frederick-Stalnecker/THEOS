**Badge Details:**
- **Creator:** Frederick Davis Stalnecker
- **Patent Status:** U.S. Patent Pending (App. No. 65/831,738)
- **Framework:** THEOS (Triadic Hierarchical Emergent Optimization System)
- **Purpose:** Certification of governance-first AI safety implementation

## What THEOS Certification Means

A system bearing the THEOS Certified badge has demonstrated:

1. **Contradiction Budgeting** — Treats contradiction as a bounded resource to prevent infinite refinement loops
2. **Transparent Reasoning** — Every reasoning step is logged and inspectable
3. **Graceful Degradation** — System degrades capabilities under threat instead of failing catastrophically
4. **Audit Trails** — Full decision logic is auditable for regulatory compliance
5. **Accumulated Wisdom** — Learns from past governance decisions without exposing adaptation to adversaries
