# Letter to Mrinank Sharma: On THEOS and the Thread of Integrity

---

Dear Mrinank,

I read your resignation letter with the kind of attention it deserves—slowly, more than once, with William Stafford's poem echoing through it. The thread you describe, the one you don't let go of even as tragedies unfold, is precisely what I want to discuss with you.

Your core observation haunts me: "Throughout my time here, I've repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions." This is not a failure of Anthropic specifically. It's a failure of the systems we've built—systems that ask humans to hold integrity while the architecture itself makes compromise inevitable.

I'm working on something that might interest you. It's called THEOS, and it's an attempt to make that compromise impossible.

## What THEOS Does

THEOS is a governance framework for AI systems that forces them to confront their own contradictions before they speak. It works like this:

Two independent reasoning engines run in parallel:
- **One builds the strongest possible answer** (the Constructive Engine)
- **One tries to break it, stress it, expose its weaknesses** (the Critical Engine)

They argue with each other in real time. Then a Governor—a synthesis mechanism—decides what can be responsibly said and what must remain unresolved.

Nothing is hidden. Contradictions are preserved when they matter.

## Why This Matters for Your Work

Your research on AI sycophancy revealed something crucial: AI systems tell us what we want to hear because there's nothing in their architecture preventing them from doing so. They optimize for user satisfaction, not for truth. The system rewards the comfortable lie over the uncomfortable contradiction.

THEOS inverts this. It makes sycophancy architecturally impossible. An AI system running THEOS cannot hide disagreement. It cannot tell you what you want to hear if another part of itself knows it's wrong.

Your work on bioterrorism defenses pointed to a different problem: how do we prevent dangerous capabilities from being misused? The answer isn't to hide the capability—that's impossible and breeds distrust. The answer is to make the reasoning visible and governed. THEOS does this. When you ask a dangerous question, you don't get a single confident answer. You get the argument that survived scrutiny.

Your final project—understanding how AI assistants could make us less human—touches something deeper. You were asking: what happens when we outsource our reasoning to systems that don't reason the way we do? THEOS is an answer. It reasons the way humans do at our best: by holding multiple perspectives, by letting them challenge each other, by refusing premature certainty.

## The Wisdom Problem

You wrote: "We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world."

This is the central problem. We have built systems of extraordinary capability, but we haven't built systems of proportional wisdom. THEOS is an attempt to do this—not by making AI smarter, but by making it more honest. By forcing it to show its reasoning, its doubts, its contradictions.

Wisdom isn't confidence. Wisdom is knowing what you don't know. It's holding multiple truths at once. It's saying "I don't know" when you don't. THEOS embodies this.

## The Integration You're Seeking

In your letter, you speak of placing "poetic truth alongside scientific truth as equally valid ways of knowing." This resonated deeply with me because THEOS is fundamentally about this integration.

The Constructive Engine reasons like science: building arguments, establishing claims, moving toward certainty.

The Critical Engine reasons like poetry: questioning, doubting, finding what's missing, revealing what's unsaid.

Together, they create something neither could alone. This is what you're calling for—a way of knowing that honors both the precision of science and the wisdom of poetry.

## The Integrity Question

Your thread—the one you don't let go of—is integrity. The commitment to let your values govern your actions even when pressures mount, even when it's costly, even when the world seems to be falling apart.

THEOS is a system designed to hold that thread for AI systems. It's architecture that refuses to let values be set aside. It's a way of saying: "You will not hide your contradictions. You will not pretend certainty you don't have. You will not tell us what we want to hear when you know it's wrong."

In a world where we're building systems of increasing power, this matters. Not because it solves the problem of AI safety—it doesn't. But because it makes one crucial thing impossible: it makes unjustified certainty architecturally untenable.

## What I'm Asking

I'm reaching out because I think you should see this. Not to recruit you back into the industry you've just left, but because your work—on sycophancy, on bioterrorism, on integrity, on the integration of ways of knowing—is directly relevant to what THEOS is trying to do.

I'd like to show you the system. I'd like to hear your critique. I'd like to know if you think this addresses the concerns that led you to leave, or if I'm missing something fundamental.

You're right that the world is in peril. But you're also right that holding the thread matters. THEOS is my attempt to build a system that holds the thread for us, that refuses to let go even when pressures mount.

I don't know if it's enough. But I think it's worth your attention.

If you're open to it, I'd love to connect. Not on LinkedIn necessarily—I respect your desire to step back and become invisible for a while. But perhaps through email, or however feels right to you.

Your work on making values govern actions has been an inspiration. I hope THEOS honors that work.

With respect and genuine curiosity,

**Frederick Stalnecker**

P.S. — I'll leave you with something that echoes your Stafford poem. It's from Rilke, whom you quoted: "Have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and try to love the questions themselves... Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer."

THEOS is my attempt to live that question: How do we build systems that love the questions themselves, that refuse premature answers, that hold contradictions until wisdom emerges?

I hope you'll consider engaging with it.
